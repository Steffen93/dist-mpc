# How to run the mpc part

## Build and run the `player` executable
```
cargo build --bin player --release  # build player executable
./target/release/player [options]
```

The following optional parameters are available:
- -a, -account: Index of the account used for the mpc execution (0 = first account, etc.). Defaults to 0.
- -c, -contract: Address of an existing mpc contract (without leading '0x'!). If not provided, a new contract will be provided as the protocol starts.

In the end you have the complete transcript file in the base directory.

## Build and run the `verifier` executable

You can verify the transcript and generate the public parameters using the following commands: 
```
cargo build --bin verifier --release  # build verifier executable
./target/release/verifier -c "<address>"
```

The following parameters are required:
- -c, -contract: Contract address of an existing mpc protocol which is finished (without leading '0x'!) 

If everything is verified successfully, two files are generated by the executable: "pk" (proving key) and "vk" (verification key)
